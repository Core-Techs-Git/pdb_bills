# Contributing to PDB BILLS

:+1::tada: First off all, thank you for joining the team :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the module pdb_bills. These are mostly guidelines, not rules but it would be better if we all try to follow them. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code guideline

### Coding rules

To keep the code base readable we use [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/) to check and format the code. For the stability [jest](https://jestjs.io/) is our best friend since every features are tested with it and the coverage requirements are:
| Criteria | Threshold |
| ---------- | --------- |
| Branches | 98% |
| Functions | 98% |
| Lines | 98% |
| Statements | 98% |

### Documentation

As of the code documentation, only src folder code is documented. How everything that's not obvious must be documented and all exported modules must be documented. We use [typedoc](https://typedoc.org/) to generate markdown documentations which are available in the `docs` folder.

## Git workflow

We adopt a branching system inspired by the [git branching model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) - introduced by Vincent Driessen - to help simplify our development and release process.

### Branch naming

Unlike the git branching model we have one main branche (master) and three groups of supporting branches (feature, release and hotfix). Here is how and why we use them:

- **master**: is always stable and production-ready. It contains the last release version of source code in production which means that tags are made from this branch.

- **release/x.y.0**: derives from master and is used to start a future release. The version name _x.y.0_ follow [semver](https://semver.org/) specification. When the release is ready it is merge rebase into master with a pull request.

- **feature/\***: derives from release/x.y.0 and is use to implement new features (by the way everything should be treated as a feature) so we have a lot of these. When a feature is done it can be merge squash back into release/x.y.0, a pull request is use for that.

- **hotfix/x.y.z**: derives from master and is used to fix a bug found in production code. When the bug is fix the branch is merge squash back into master with a pull request. To preserve modifications made in hotfix branch we can merge squash it into the current release/x.y.0 branch using this git command

  ```Shell
  $ git checkout release/x.y.z
  $ git merge -s recursive -X theirs --squash hotfix/x.y.z
  $ git push origin release/x.y.z
  ```

### Commit messages

We use the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to guide our commit messages structure. On top of this convention we use the [commintlint package](https://commitlint.js.org/) to enforce its application so we can automaticaly generate the [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Core-Techs-Git/pdb_bills/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
For us a valid commit message should:

- Follow the pattern
  ```plaintext
  type(scope?)?: subject (R-ticket)?
  body?
  footer?
  ```
- Limit the header line to 72 characters or less
- Capitalize the subject line
- Use the imperative, present tense
- Have an emoji as `type` in the header. Here is the list of allowed emoji

  | Emoji | Description                                                                           |

### Pull request guideline and labels

When merging a pull request, the merged branch is most of the time squash into the orther branch. Every pull requests must be labeled accordingly using these labels

| Category | Label       | Description                                                                       |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Priority | High        | Indicate pull requests that affect all releases and need to be deployed soon      |
| Priority | Low         | Indicates pull requests that don't affect any release code                        |
| Priority | Medium      | Indicates pull requests that need to be deployed with the next release            |
| Status   | Abandoned   | Indicates pull requests that are no longer needed                                 |

| Status   | Completed   | Indicates that work on pull requests is finished                                  |
| Status   | In progress | Indicates pull requests which are still being worked on, more changes will follow |
| Type     | Bug         | Indicates an unexpected problem or unintended behavior in production source code  |
| Type     | Duplicate   | Indicates similar issues or pull requests                                         |
| Type     | Feature     | Indicates new feature pull requests                                               |
